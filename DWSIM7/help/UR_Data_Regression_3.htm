<H3>Data & Regression</H3>
This page is used to enter experimental data, run the regression and display results. <br>
At the moment this tool only can be used with LLE data for regression.<br>

<H3>Data table</H3>
You may copy experimental data from other programs and paste them into this table. To delete a complete row
you press Strg+Del.<br><br>

<b>Columns X1'/X1":</b>These both columns contain molar fractions of component 1 (here Benzonitril) in liquid
phase 1 ( X1') and liquid phase 2 (X1").<br>
 
<b>Column T:</b> Enter temperature of every dataset here.<br><br>

The following columns contain results and can not be edited.<br><br>
As soon as you delivered all experimental data you may press button<br>
 
<b>Regress IPs :</b> Regression of the selected interaction parameters are done. The final results are written
to the parameter input fields on page "Model".<br>
The regression procedure is as following for Modified UNIFAC models: For every data set a combination of 
"aij" and "aji" parameters is regressed. These parameters are displayed in the green columns. After finishing that 
procedure for every data set an interpolation over temperature is done to calculate final parameters for 
aij/aji and bij/bji which represent temperature dependence of interaction parameters.<br><br>

If the selected model is UNIFAC the calculations are done in a slightly different way. This model is not 
able to account for temperature dependence of interactions and a reasonable parameter set has to be found. 
DWSIM selects the middle of the experimental temperature range to calculate interaction parameters from 
interpolated values. With the button<br>
<b>New Temperature </b>you also can recalculate interaction parameters for a different and more suitable temperature.
This button together with a temperature input field is only visible when using UNIFAC as model.<br><br>

<b>Draw Diagram: </b>This button will draw a diagram of experimental data together with calculated data from
actual interaction parameters. You may also draw this diagram in advance to regression or after setting
a new reference temperature for UNIFAC model to compare the changes. The calculated equilibrium data are displayed
in the grey columns together with an error indicator of that dataset.<br><br>

<b>Draw IPs: </b>This button wil draw a diagram of interaction parameters over the temperature 
range of experimental data.<br><br>
