<h3>Usage</h3><br>

The functionality of that Add-In is realised by offering special functions which are used for doing calculations 
for process simulation via an Excel interface. This interface allows access to the original DWSIM thermodynamics engine and 
component databases.<br><br>
You start by add a new function to do your calculations by pressing the marked Symbor "<b>fx</b>" left of the edit field:<br>
<br>

Now the following dialog appears. Functions exposed by this AddIn will be grouped in a category named &#8220;DWSIM&#8221;. You may click 
the marked link in this dialog to get further help on that function.<br>
<br>

After selecting the required function and pressing OK the following dialog appears:<br>
<br>

Be aware, that some functions need a lot of parameters which will not fit into this dialog. The picture shows an example of 
the PTFlash function where the parameters already were defined. You will find the marked slider at the right side which will
allow you to scroll down to edit the other parameters.<br>
<br>

<hr><br>
All DWSIM functions are one ore two dimensional <b><i>Matrix formulas</i></b> which may be recognised by their curly brackets: <b>{}</b>.<br>
This kind of formulas is entered in Excel in three steps as depicted in the following picture:<br>
<ol>
 <li>Enter a formula into the first top left cell of the result range (A2). The formula doesn't contain the brackets now.</li>
 <li>Select the required result range (A2:A16) with top left cell highlighted.</li>
 <li>The formula needs to be modified into a matrix formula now. This is accomplished by editing the formula and finishin editing 
by using <b><i>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</i></b> keys.</li>
</ol>


Property and Equilibrium calculation functions require parameters that must be one or more values which were 
returned by functions <b>GetPropPackList, GetCompoundList, GetPropList, GetCompoundPropList and GetPhaseList</b>.<br>

These formulas will return values listed in a single column:<br>

As an different example, the <b>PTFlash</b> function requires the name of the Property Package to use, the compound names 
and mole fractions, temperature in K, pressure in Pa.<br>

You may optionally provide new interaction parameters that will override the ones used internally by DWSIM.<br>

The calculation results will be returned as a two dimensional (n+2) x (4) matrix, where n is the number of compounds.<br>
First row will contain the phase names (Vapor, Liquid, Liquid2 and Solid, in this order), the second will 
contain the phase mole fractions and the other lines will contain the compound mole fractions in the corresponding phases:<br><br>

For PH, PS, TVF and PVF flash calculation functions, an additional line is returned that will contain the temperature in K or 
pressure in Pa in the first column.<br>
<h3>Ribbon Menu<br>
</h3>

<br>
After activating DWSIM's add-in, a ribbon menu will appear on Excel 2007 and newer:<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 212px; height: 88px;" alt="" src="Pictures/Excel10.png"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">- Options:</span> click to edit some settings for the add-in<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">- Help:</span> opens this help file<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">- About: </span>displays the About Box with information about add-in version, copyright and licensing.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">- Open Sample Sheet:</span> opens a sample excel sheet with add-in function calls.<br>
<h3>Options</h3>
<br>
The options dialog lets you configure the calculation mode (CPU and GPU
parallel acceleration), configure the flash algorithm settings and also
how to handle add-in internal errors.<br>
<br>
Settings are saved to and read from a file in a folder named "DWSIM Application Data" inside your "My Documents" folder.<br>
