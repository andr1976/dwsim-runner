<p>The Pipe Segment unit operation can be used to simulate fluid
flow process through
a pipe. Two of the most used multiphase correlations for the
calculation of pressure drop are available in
DWSIM: Beggs &amp; Brill and Lockhart &amp; Martinelli.
Temperature can be rigorously calculated considering external
environment effects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pipe segment is divided in segments, which can be straight
tubes, valves, curves, etc. Each segment is subdivided in small
sections for calculation convergence purposes, as defined by the user.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p><h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Input Parameters</h3>


<b><br>Pipe Specification: </b>selects the specification for the pipe calculation procedure. Options are: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Length</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Outlet Pressure</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Outlet Temperature</span>.<b><br></b><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Length</span>:&nbsp;specify segments' length to calculate outlet pressure and temperature; </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Outlet Pressure</span>:&nbsp;specify outlet pressure to calculate temperature and resulting length for a single, straight pipe segment; </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Outlet Temperature</span>:
specify outlet temperature and segments' length to calculate outlet
pressure and heat exchanged. Heat balance calculation setting
automatically switches to 'Heat Exchanged' in this mode.</li></ul><b>Pressure drop correlation: </b>select the model
to be used for the pressure drop calculation in
the pipe segment.
<br><b><br>Hydraulic profile: </b>clicking on the
ellipsis button opens the pipe hydraulic profile editor. Here the user
adds segments, defines their type and into
how many increments it will be divided during the calculations. Also
the pipe material, length,
elevation, internal and external diameters are defined. Each change can
be saved by clicking the "Apply" button.
<br><b><br>Thermal profile: </b>clicking on the
ellipsis button opens the pipe thermal profile editor. In the thermal
profile editor it is possible to define how the temperature profile in
the
pipe will be calculated. The settings in this window are valid for all
pipe segments. Changes are saved automatically.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Include Joule-Thomson cooling effect:</span> considers the Joule-Thomson cooling effect when the flowing fluid is in the vapor phase.
<h3>Calculation method</h3><br>The pipe segment is calculated based on incremental mass and energy
balances. The complete algorithm consists in three nested loops. The
external loop iterates
on the sections (increments), the middle loop iterates on the
temperature and the internal loop
calculates the pressure.<br>
<br>
The pressure and temperature are calculated as follows:
<ol>
<li>The inlet temperature and pressure are used to estimate the
increment outlet pressure and temperature.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Fluid properties are calculated based in a arithmetic mean
of inlet and outlet conditions.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The calculated properties and the inlet pressure are used
to calculate the pressure drop. With it, the outlet pressure is
calculated.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The calculated and estimated pressure are compared, and if
their difference exceeds the
tolerance, a new outlet pressure is estimated, and the steps 2 and 3
are repeated. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Once the internal loop has converged, the outlet
temperature is calculated. If the global
heat transfer coefficient (U) was given, the outlet temperature is
calculated from the following
equation:<br>
<br>
<center><b>`Q=U*A*&#916;T_(LMTD)`</b></center>
<br>
where: Q = heat transferred, U = overall heat transfer coefficient, A = heat transfer area (external surface)
and &#916;T<sub>LMTD</sub> =
logarithmic mean temperature difference.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
The calculated temperature is compared to the estimated one, and if
their difference
exceeds the specified tolerance, a new temperature is estimated and new
properties are
calculated (return to step 2).<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
When both pressure and temperature converges, the results are passed to
the next increment,
where calculation restarts.<br>
</li>
</ol>If<span style="font-style: italic;"> Outlet Pressure</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Outlet Temperature</span> specification mode is selected, an additional loop is added outside the above procedure, which does one of the following:<br><ul><li>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Outlet Pressure</span>
mode, the length of the first segment, which must be a straight tube,
is changed&nbsp;until the calculated&nbsp;outlet pressure matches the
specified one. </li><li>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Outlet Temperature</span>
mode, the overall heat exchanged value is changed until the calculated
outlet temperature matches the specified one. Heat balance calculation
setting automatically switches to 'Heat Exchanged' in this mode.</li></ul><h4>
Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient (U) calculation method</h4>
When Overall HTC calculation mode is enabled through the Thermal
Profile editor, DWSIM calculates the Overall HTC by using the following
relation, based on the theory of resistance to heat transfer between pipe's internal and external media:<br>
<br><div style="text-align: center;">
`1/U=1/h_("int")+l_("wall")/k_("wall")+l_("ins")/k_("ins")+1/h_("ext")`, where<br></div>
<br>`h_("int")` = internal convective heat transfer coefficient<br>`l_("wall")` = pipe wall thickness<br>`k_("wall")` = pipe wall conductive heat transfer coefficient (thermal conductivity)<br>`l_("ins")` = pipe insulation thickness<br>`k_("ins")` = pipe insulation conductive heat transfer coefficient (thermal conductivity)<br>`h_("ext")` = external convective heat transfer coefficient<br><br>Internal HTC is calculated using the Petukhov correlation:<br>&nbsp;<br><div style="text-align: center;">`h = k / d_("int") *&nbsp;f / 8 *&nbsp;Re * "Pr" / (1.07 + 12.7 * (f / 8) ^ 0.5 * (Pr ^ (2 / 3) - 1))`<br></div><br>External HTC is calculated using the Holman correlation:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">`h = 0.25 * k / d_(ext) *&nbsp;&nbsp;Re ^ 0.6 *&nbsp;Pr ^ 0.38`</div><br>Each
term in the Overall HTC&nbsp;expression is added to the sum if it is
checked to be included in the calculation through the Thermal Profile
Editor.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Joule-Thomson cooling effect</span><br><br>The Joule-Thomson effect on the temperature drop is calculated by the following relation:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">`eta = (dP) / (dT) = 1 / (Cp_m * w) * [w_v / rho_v * (-T_("in") / z * dz / (dT)) + w_l / rho_l]`<br><br>`T_(out) = T_(out0) + eta * (P_("in") - P_(out))`<br></div><br>In
the above expressions, the Joule-Thomson expansion coefficient is
calculated using properties of the vapor and liquid phases. The heat
balance-calculated outlet temperature is then corrected to include the
JT effect by using the calculated expansion coefficient multiplied by
the pressure drop in the current segment.<br><h3>Output Parameters</h3><b><br>Delta-T: </b>temperature drop in the pipe segment.<br>
