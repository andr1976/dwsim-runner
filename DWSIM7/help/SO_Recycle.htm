<p>The Recycle operation is composed by a block in the flowsheet which does convergence
verifications in systems were downstream material connects somewhere upstream in the
diagram. With this tool it is possible to build complex flowsheets, with many recycles, and solve
them in an efficient way by using the acceleration methods presents in this logical operation.<br><br>

To include this operation the recycled stream is connected to the input of that object. The output is connected
to an object somewhere earlier in the simulation as input again.

<h3>Input Parameters</h3>
<b>Acceleration Method</b><br>
There are two acceleration methods available: Wegstein and Dominant Eigenvalue. The
Wegstein method must be used when there isn&#8217;t a significant interaction between convergent
variables, in the contrary the other method can be used. The successive substitution method is
slow, but convergence is guaranteed.<br><br>

<b>Wegstein parameters</b><br>
The Wegstein method requires some parameters which can be edited by the user. <br><br>

<b>Eigenvalue parameters</b><br>
The dominant eigenvalue does not require any additional parameter.<br><br>
 
<b>Convergence parameters</b><br>
The user can define convergence parameters for temperature, pressure and mass flow in the recycle, 
that is, the minimum acceptable values for the difference in these values between the inlet and outlet streams, which,
rigorously, must be identical. The smaller these values are, the more time is used by the calculator
in order to converge the recycle.<br><br>


<h3>Results</h3>
As a result, the actual error values are shown, together with the necessary convergence iteration steps.

<h2>Energy Recycle</h2>
The Energy Recycle logical operation works the same way as the normal Recycle, except that it
is aimed at Energy Streams. Here, instead of defining convergence parameters for temperature,
pressure and flow rate, you&#8217;ll define the convergence error for the energy only.
