<p>DWSIM has a model for the countercurrent, two-stream heat exchanger
which supports phase
change and multiple phases in a stream.</p>
<h3>Input Parameters</h3>
<br>

The heat exchanger in DWSIM has five calculation modes:<br>

      
<ol>
<li>Calculate <b>hot fluid outlet temperature</b>: you must
provide the cold fluid outlet temperature
and the exchange area to calculate the hot fluid temperature.</li><li>Calculate <b>cold fluid outlet temperature</b>: in this
mode, DWSIM needs the hot fluid outlet
temperature and the exchange area to calculate the cold fluid
temperature.</li><li><b>Calculate both temperatures</b>: in this mode, DWSIM
needs the exchange area A and heat
exchanged to calculate both temperatures.</li><li><b>Calculate both temperatures (UA)</b>: in this mode, DWSIM
needs the exchange area A and heat exchange coefficient U to calculate
both outlet temperatures and transfered heat.</li><li><b>Calculate area</b>: in this mode you must provide the
HTC and both temperatures to calculate
the exchange area.</li><li><b>Rate</b> a Shell and Tube exchanger: in this mode you
must provide the exchanger geometry
and DWSIM will calculate output temperatures, pressure drop on the
shell and tubes,
overall HTC, LMTD, and exchange area. This calculation mode uses a
simplified version
of Tinker&#8217;s method [1] for Shell and Tube exchanger calculations.</li>
</ol>

      <br>

You can provide the pressure drop for both fluids in the exchanger for
modes 1 to 4 only.
<h3>Calculation Method</h3>

<br>
The heat exchanger in DWSIM is calculated using the simple convection
heat equation:<br>

<br>
`Q = U*A*DeltaT_(lmtd)`<br>
<br>

where: `Q` = heat transferred, `A` = heat transfer area (external surface)
and `DeltaT_(lmtd)` = Logarithmic
Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD).<br>

<br>

We also remember that:<br>

<br>
`Q = m*DeltaH`<br>
<br>

where: `Q` = heat transferred from/to the fluid and `DeltaH` = outlet-inlet
enthalpy difference.<br>

<br>
First, the maximum theoretical heat exchange value is calculated by the following relation:<br>
<br>
`Q_(max) = W_(hot) * ( H_(hot,"in") - H_(hot,out (Tcold,"in")))`<br>
<br>
where<br>
<br>
`W_(hot)` is the mass flow of the hot fluid entering the exchanger<br>
`H_(hot,"in")` is the specific enthalpy of the hot fluid entering the exchanger<br>
`H_(hot,out (Tcold,"in"))` is the specific enthalpy of the hot fluid calculated at the cold fluid's inlet temperature<br>
<br>
Thermal efficiency is then defined as<br>
<br>
`epsilon = Q / Q_(max) * 100`<br>
<br>

The calculation procedure that follows depends on the selected mode:<br>

<ol>

  <li>Calculate hot fluid outlet temperature: HTC (Heat Transfer
Coefficient), hot fluid outlet temperature, heat load and LMTD.</li>
  <li>Calculate cold fluid outlet temperature: HTC, cold fluid outlet
temperature, heat load and LMTD.</li>
  <li>Calculate both temperatures: HTC, cold and hot fluid outlet
temperatures and LMTD.</li>
  <li>Calculate area: exchange area and LMTD.</li>
  <li>Rate Shell and Tube exchanger: exchanger geometry information.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Results</h3>
<br>

The results given by the heat exchanger after calculation depends on
the mode selected:
<ol>

  <li>Calculate hot fluid outlet temperature: overall HTC, hot fluid
outlet temperature, heat load and LMTD.</li>
  <li>Calculate cold fluid outlet temperature: overall HTC, cold fluid
outlet temperature, heat load and LMTD.</li>
  <li>Calculate both temperatures: overall HTC, cold and hot fluid
outlet temperatures and LMTD.</li>
  <li>Calculate area: exchange area and LMTD.</li>
  <li>Rate Shell and Tube exchanger: area, LMTD, LMTD correction factor
(F), overall HTC, hot fluid outlet temperature, cold fluid outlet
temperature, hot fluid pressure drop (shell/tubes only), cold fluid
pressure drop (shell/tubes only).</li>
</ol>
